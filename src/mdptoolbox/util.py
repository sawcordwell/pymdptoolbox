    #
    # tranitions must be a numpy array either an AxSxS ndarray (with any 
    # dtype other than "object"); or, a 1xA ndarray with a "object" dtype, 
    # and each element containing an SxS array. An AxSxS array will be
    # be converted to an object array. A numpy object array is similar to a
    # MATLAB cell array.
    #
    # NumPy has an array type of 'object', which is roughly equivalent to
    # the MATLAB cell array. These are most useful for storing sparse
    # matrices as these can only have two dimensions whereas we want to be
    # able to store a transition matrix for each action. If the dytpe of
    # the transition probability array is object then we store this as
    # P_is_object = True.
    # If it is an object array, then it should only have one dimension
    # otherwise fail with a message expalining why.
    # If it is a normal array then the number of dimensions must be exactly
    # three, otherwise fail with a message explaining why.
    #
    # As above but for the reward array. A difference is that the reward
    # array can have either two or 3 dimensions.
    #
    # We want to make sure that the transition probability array and the 
    # reward array are in agreement. This means that both should show that
    # there are the same number of actions and the same number of states.
    # Furthermore the probability of transition matrices must be SxS in
    # shape, so we check for that also.
    #
        # If the user has put their transition matrices into a numpy array
        # with dtype of 'object', then it is possible that they have made a
        # mistake and not all of the matrices are of the same shape. So,
        # here we record the number of actions and states that the first
        # matrix in element zero of the object array says it has. After
        # that we check that every other matrix also reports the same
        # number of actions and states, otherwise fail with an error.
        # aP: the number of actions in the transition array. This
        # corresponds to the number of elements in the object array.
        #
        # sP0: the number of states as reported by the number of rows of
        # the transition matrix
        # sP1: the number of states as reported by the number of columns of
        # the transition matrix
        #
        # Now we check to see that every element of the object array holds
        # a matrix of the same shape, otherwise fail.
        #
            # sp0aa and sp1aa represents the number of states in each
            # subsequent element of the object array. If it doesn't match
            # what was found in the first element, then we need to fail
            # telling the user what needs to be fixed.
            #
        # if we are using a normal array for this, then the first
        # dimension should be the number of actions, and the second and 
        # third should be the number of states
        #
    # the first dimension of the transition matrix must report the same
    # number of states as the second dimension. If not then we are not
    # dealing with a square matrix and it is not a valid transition
    # probability. Also, if the number of actions is less than one, or the
    # number of states is less than one, then it also is not a valid
    # transition probability.
    #
    # now we check that each transition matrix is square-stochastic. For
    # object arrays this is the matrix held in each element, but for
    # normal arrays this is a matrix formed by taking a slice of the array
    #
        # if the rewarad array has an object dtype, then we check that
        # each element contains a matrix of the same shape as we did 
        # above with the transition array.
        #
        # This indicates that the reward matrices are constructed per 
        # transition, so that the first dimension is the actions and
        # the second two dimensions are the states.
        #
        # then the reward matrix is per state, so the first dimension is 
        # the states and the second dimension is the actions.
        #
        # this is added just so that the next check doesn't error out
        # saying that sR1 doesn't exist
        #
    # the number of actions must be more than zero, the number of states
    # must also be more than 0, and the states must agree
    #
    # now we check to see that what the transition array is reporting and
    # what the reward arrar is reporting agree as to the number of actions
    # and states. If not then fail explaining the situation
