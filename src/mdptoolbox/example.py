def forest(S=3, r1=4, r2=2, p=0.1, is_sparse=False):
    """Generate a MDP example based on a simple forest management scenario.

    This function is used to generate a transition probability
    (``A`` × ``S`` × ``S``) array ``P`` and a reward (``S`` × ``A``) matrix
    ``R`` that model the following problem. A forest is managed by two actions:
    'Wait' and 'Cut'. An action is decided each year with first the objective
    to maintain an old forest for wildlife and second to make money selling cut
    wood. Each year there is a probability ``p`` that a fire burns the forest.

    Here is how the problem is modelled.
    Let {0, 1 . . . ``S``-1 } be the states of the forest, with ``S``-1 being
    the oldest. Let 'Wait' be action 0 and 'Cut' be action 1.
    After a fire, the forest is in the youngest state, that is state 0.
    The transition matrix ``P`` of the problem can then be defined as follows::

                   | p 1-p 0.......0  |
                   | .  0 1-p 0....0  |
        P[0,:,:] = | .  .  0  .       |
                   | .  .        .    |
                   | .  .         1-p |
                   | p  0  0....0 1-p |

                   | 1 0..........0 |
                   | . .          . |
        P[1,:,:] = | . .          . |
                   | . .          . |
                   | . .          . |
                   | 1 0..........0 |

    The reward matrix R is defined as follows::

                 |  0  |
                 |  .  |
        R[:,0] = |  .  |
                 |  .  |
                 |  0  |
                 |  r1 |

                 |  0  |
                 |  1  |
        R[:,1] = |  .  |
                 |  .  |
                 |  1  |
                 |  r2 |

    Parameters
    ---------
    S : int, optional
        The number of states, which should be an integer greater than 1.
        Default: 3.
    r1 : float, optional
        The reward when the forest is in its oldest state and action 'Wait' is
        performed. Default: 4.
    r2 : float, optional
        The reward when the forest is in its oldest state and action 'Cut' is
        performed. Default: 2.
    p : float, optional
        The probability of wild fire occurence, in the range ]0, 1[. Default:
        0.1.
    is_sparse : bool, optional
        If True, then the probability transition matrices will be returned in
        sparse format, otherwise they will be in dense format. Default: False.

    Returns
    -------
    out : tuple
        ``out[0]`` contains the transition probability matrix P  and ``out[1]``
        contains the reward matrix R. If ``is_sparse=False`` then P is a numpy
        array with a shape of ``(A, S, S)`` and R is a numpy array with a shape
        of ``(S, A)``. If ``is_sparse=True`` then P is a tuple of length ``A``
        where each ``P[a]`` is a scipy sparse CSR format matrix of shape
        ``(S, S)``; R remains the same as in the case of ``is_sparse=False``.
